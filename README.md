# Multi-Pic-Resizer

Multiple Picture Resizer. (Only .jpg Supported)

I was working on an online Shopping Website “https://caterers.rubick.org/design-you-own-menu/” and There were multiple pictures needed to pasted on Order Selection. Pictures of different sizes made page look very unorganized so birth of this application

Download Pictures for your project. Once the pictures are done. Select the folder containing all the pictures and then select the common resolution. It will resize all the pictures with on resolution so the page / presentation will look more elegant and organized

Working:

Open The Application.


Select Folder Where Pictures are (Currently Only Supports .jpg files. Will add more formats later on)


Select Output Folder (Selecting Same Input and Output Folder will replace the files with new resolutions. Action Cannot be reversed)


Enter Resolution Width and Height (Only Numbers – No Decimal/Alphabets


That’s all

Note:
It will only change the resolution so picture quality will be affected.

Be careful with portrait and landscape pictures. (i.e: Giving portrait resolution to a landscape picture)

Compatibility:

Requires Windows 7 SP1 or above
